CanvasKeyboard
==============
This is a quick hack of an isomorphic keyboard with the [Wicki-Hayden note layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki-Hayden_note_layout).

# Usage

Run `npm install`, and `npm start` to start the dev server on localhost:8080.

Or just play with it on [Github Pages](https://uber5001.github.io/CanvasKeyboard/)
